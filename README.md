# Udacity Deep Learning course

Assignments of the Udacity Deep Learning course. This MOOC is Given by Vincent Vanhoucke, Principal Scientist at Google and technical lead in the Google Brain team. 

This repository contains the assignments I have done. The course is **free** but there is no support expect if you register to a [nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree). That's why I'm sharing a work that could be useful.

The course is great! You will design and implement Neural Networks for image recognition, natural language processing with embeddings and character based text generation with RNN/LTSM and Seq2Seq.

## Credits

+ all the assignments come from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) and the [TensorFlow repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/udacity)
+ the fonts dataset used for this image recognition is the [notMNIST dataset](ttp://yaroslavvb.blogspot.fr/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) from Yaroslav Bulatov
+ the neural network of the assignment #4 is loosely inspired by the classical LeNet-5, as described in the research paper ["Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition"](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf) by Y. LeCun, L. Bottou, Y. Bengio and P. Haffner
